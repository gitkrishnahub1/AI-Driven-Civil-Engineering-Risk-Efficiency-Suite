# AI-Driven-Civil-Engineering-Risk-Efficiency-Suite
AI-Driven dashboard for monitoring structural risks, project delays, and financial health across 1,000+ infrastructure sites.

## 📌 Project Overview
[cite_start]As a former Civil Engineer  [cite_start]transitioning into Data Analytics[cite: 5], I developed this end-to-end analytical suite to address the three biggest "pain points" in construction management: **Cost Overruns, Safety Risks, and Schedule Delays.**

This project utilizes Power BI to transform raw site data into actionable intelligence for project stakeholders.

## 📊 Key Business Insights
* **Financial Oversight:** Identified **$5.13B** in total cost overruns across the portfolio.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Pinpointed that **~79% of projects** faced significant delays, allowing for targeted resource reallocation.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Correlated weather-impact data with structural sensor anomalies (vibration spikes) to identify high-risk zones before site escalation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
* [cite_start]**Data Visualization:** Power BI (Advanced DAX, Power Query, Bookmarks) [cite: 10]
* [cite_start]**Analytical Techniques:** Anomaly Detection, Correlation Analysis, KPI Tracking [cite: 11]
* [cite_start]**Domain Expertise:** Structural Integrity, Site-Safety Conformance, Cost Control [cite: 7, 26]

## 📂 Project Structure
* `Risk_Dashboard.pbix`: The core Power BI file containing the interactive report.
* `Data/`: Folder containing (simulated) project datasets including vibration logs, weather data, and financial records.
* `Screenshots/`: Visual previews of the dashboard for quick viewing.

## 🚀 How to View
1. Download the `.pbix` file from this repository.
2. Open with **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Interact with the filters to see how "Weather" and "Project Type" impact structural risk scores.
